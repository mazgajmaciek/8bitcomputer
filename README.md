8bit computer build project readme  

# Introduction
Some time ago I've stumbled upon a video series on YT done by Ben Eater (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) explaining in great detail how to build an 8bit computer. Finally, all parts (apart from two - I don't need them just yet though) from 5 different vendors are here so the build can start!

Overall, electronics in general has been a topic I wanted to dig into some more for quite a while now so I thought building an 8bit from stratch can't be *that* hard, right? Also, I've always wanted to thoroughly understand how computer *really* work "under the hood". And since the principles are still the same, I should be able to learn something from it, too.

Let's find out. I don't have any electronics background, just did some programming/testing in my spare time/at work so I'm curious myself how long it's gonna take.

# Clock Module
So far so good, looks like I've still got all the parts I need and first Clock Module prototype seems to be working:
